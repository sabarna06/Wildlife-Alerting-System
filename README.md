# Wildlife-Alerting-System
In the realm of computer vision, this project presents a comprehensive solution for image classification, specifically focusing on the detection of humans in wildlife areas and the identification of diverse animals. The models are carefully crafted to address unique challenges associated with human and animal detection in natural environments. The integration of both models is facilitated through the Gradio library, offering an intuitive and interactive interface for users.
# About-the-models-and-interface
Human Detection Model:
The human detection model is trained on a dataset specifically curated for wildlife scenarios. It leverages the MobileNetV2 architecture, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN). The model's pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset enable it to capture relevant features, while fine-tuning ensures adaptability to the challenges posed by wildlife environments.

Animal Detection Model:
The animal detection model also employs the MobileNetV2 architecture, benefiting from its real-time capabilities and strong performance in image classification tasks. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, this model is capable of recognizing a wide array of animals. A carefully curated list of animal labels enhances the model's precision in identifying specific species.

Integrated Gradio Interface:
The Gradio library serves as the backbone for seamlessly combining both human and animal detection models into a unified interface. This interface allows users, including wildlife researchers, conservationists, and enthusiasts, to effortlessly upload images and receive instant feedback on the presence of humans and the identification of animals. The integration aims to democratize access to advanced computer vision capabilities and make them accessible to a broader audience.
